 Kajal's Portfolio


Responsive Portfolio built using Bootstrap

This project required to build of a responsive portfolio website by using Bootstrap and it's grid system. The portfolio  have 3 functional pages: an 'About Me'/home page, a Portfolio page and a Contact page.

My site looks polished. Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Use mobile-first design.

* Updated GitHub Profile.

* Updated LinkedIn profile.

* Click "Customize your pins".

* Click the checkboxes for your project and two to three homework assignments that you would like to share.

* Make sure each of these projects is deployed, and add a link to the deployed project in the README file.

* Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network, and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is about writing code.

* A link to a PDF of your resume

Updated LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github profile and portfolio.
