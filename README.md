Responsive Portfolio

I've created a mobile responsive portfolio website to showcase my projects and accomplishments by using Bootstrap CSS Framework. To create this responsive layout, I use my own CSS file for some of the finishing touches.

Within the application you will get
A responsive layout
Responsive images
Working links within the navbar to the About, Contact and Portfolio pages
My personal bio, images, social media and projects
A sticky footer

Within the source code you will get
Proper use of Bootstraps 
Semantic valid HTML
I have not use of media queries as Bootstrap has minimized their need
Below are the summery:

   * A responsive navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images
   
   * Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

   * Functional, deployed application

   * I have my GitHub repository with README describing the project


Below is the link to the finished application along with a screenshot of each page


* The URLs of the deployed applications

* The URLs of the GitHub repositories
