Responsive Portfolio

I've created a mobile responsive portfolio website to showcase my projects and accomplishments by using Bootstrap CSS Framework. To create this responsive layout, I use my own CSS file for some of the finishing touches.

Within the application you will get
A responsive layout
Responsive images
Working links within the navbar to the About, Contact and Portfolio pages
My personal bio, images, social media and projects
A sticky footer

Within the source code you will get
Proper use of Bootstraps 
Semantic valid HTML
I have not use of media queries as Bootstrap has minimized their need
Below are the summery:

   * A responsive navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images
   
   * Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

   * Functional, deployed application

   * I have my GitHub repository with README describing the project


To impress recruiter for example, I make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, use the bootstrap and CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Below is the link to the finished application along with a screenshot of each page
